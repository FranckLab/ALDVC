%% regularizeNdMatrices
% Returns the needed matrices used in the regulareNd problem. Often used for 
% constrained problems.
%%
% 
%   [Afidelity, Lreg] = regularizeNdMatrices(x, xGrid)
%   [Afidelity, Lreg] = regularizeNdMatrices(x, xGrid, smoothness)
%   [Afidelity, Lreg] = regularizeNdMatrices(x, xGrid, smoothness, interpMethod)
%
%% Inputs
% *x* - column vector or matrix of column vectors, containing scattered data. 
% Each row contains one point. Each column corresponds to a dimension.
% 
% *xGrid* - cell array containing vectors defining the nodes in the grid 
% in each dimension. xGrid{1} corresponds with x(:,1) for instance. Unequal spacing 
% in the grid vectors is allowed. The grid vectors must completely span x. For 
% instance the values of x(:,1) must be within the bounds of xGrid{1}. If xGrid 
% does not span x, an error is thrown.
% 
% *smoothness* - scalar or vector. - The numerical "measure" of what we want 
% to achieve along an axis/dimension, regardless of the resolution, the aspect 
% ratio between axes, or the scale of the overall problem. The ratio of smoothness 
% to fidelity of the output surface, i.e. ratio of smoothness to "goodness of 
% fit." This must be a positive real number. If it is a vector, it must have same 
% number of elements as columns in x.
% 
% A smoothness of 1 gives equal weight to fidelity (goodness of fit) and 
% smoothness of the output surface. This results in noticeable smoothing. If your 
% input data has little or no noise, use 0.01 to give smoothness 1% as much weight 
% as goodness of fit. 0.1 applies a little bit of smoothing to the output surface.
% 
% If this parameter is a vector, then it defines the relative smoothing to 
% be associated with each axis/dimension. This allows the user to apply a different 
% amount of smoothing in the each axis/dimension.
%%
% 
%   DEFAULT: 0.01
%
% 
% *interpMethod* - character, denotes the interpolation scheme used to interpolate 
% the data.
% 
% Even though there is a computational complexity difference between linear, 
% nearest, and cubic interpolation methods, the interpolation method is not the 
% dominant factor in the calculation time in regularizeNd. The dominant factor 
% in calculation time is the size of the grid and the solver used. So in general, 
% do not choose your interpolation method based on computational complexity. Choose 
% your interpolation method because of the accuracty and shape that you are looking 
% to obtain.
% 
% * 'linear' - Uses linear interpolation within the grid. linear interpolation 
% requires that extrema occur at the grid points. linear should be smoother than 
% nearest for the same grid. As the number of dimension grows, the number of grid 
% points used to interpolate at a query point grows with 2^nDimensions. i.e. 2d 
% needs 4 points, 3d needs 8 points, 4d needs 16 points per query point. In general, 
% linear can use smaller smoothness values than cubic and still be well conditioned.
% * 'nearest' - Nearest neighbor interpolation. Nearest should be the least 
% complex but least smooth.
% * 'cubic' - Uses Lagrange cubic interpolation. Cubic interpolation allows 
% extrema to occur at other locations besides the grid points. Cubic should provide 
% the most flexible relationship for a given xGrid. As the number of dimension 
% grows, the number of grid points used to interpolate at a query point grows 
% with 4^nDimensions. i.e. 2d needs 16 points, 3d needs 64 points, 4d needs 256 
% points per query point. cubic has good properties of accuracy and smoothness 
% but is the most complex interpMethod to calculate.
%%
% 
%   DEFAULT: 'linear'
%
%% Output
% *Afidelity* - matirx. contains the fidelity equations. size(A,1) == size(x,1) 
% == size(y,1). The number of rows in A corresponds to the number of points in 
% x,y. The number of columns corresponds to the number points in the grid.
% 
% *Lreg* - Cell array. L{i} corresponds to the scaled 2nd derivative regularization 
% of the ith dimension.
%% Description
% regularizeNdMatrices is most often is used for adding contraints to what regularizeNd 
% would produce. The matrices output from regularizeNdMatrices are used with constraint 
% matrices in a linear least squares constrained optimization problem. % For an 
% example of how to do constrained optimization with regularizeNdMatrices, see 
% "constraint_and_Mapping_Example" example.
% 
% regularizeNdMatrices outputs the matrices used in regularizeNd. There are 
% two parts: the fidelity part and the regularization part. The fidelity controls 
% the accuracy of the fitted lookup table. The regularization part controls the 
% smoothness of the lookup table.
